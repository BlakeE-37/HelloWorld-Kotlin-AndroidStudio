# Overview

This is an app made in Android Studio in Kotlin, it is a mobile game used to help teach and educate children in elementary school. The game loop is alot like the game heads up. One player has the phone on their forhead, a term will appear, and the other player's goal is to describe the term. There are four categories to choose from (People, Animals, Movies, and Places), and three difficulties. In order for a player to score a point or skip a question, the phone is rotated. Players are given one point for each correct answer.
